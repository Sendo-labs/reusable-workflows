## Versioning This Repository

This repository uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Automated Release with Release Please

This project uses Google's [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate releases.

#### Commit Format

```bash
# Feature (bumps MINOR: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
feat: add new workflow for Docker builds
feat(npm): support custom registry authentication

# Fix (bumps PATCH: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
fix: correct timeout handling in release workflow
fix(release): handle missing changelog file

# Breaking Change (bumps MAJOR: 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
feat!: redesign npm-publish workflow API
feat(release)!: remove deprecated artifact-path option

# Other types (included in changelog but no version bump)
docs: update README with new examples
chore: update dependencies
refactor: simplify version normalization
```

#### How It Works

On every push to `main`, Release Please:

1. **Analyzes commits** since the last release (via Conventional Commits)
2. **Creates/updates an automated PR** with:
   - The calculated new version
   - Generated CHANGELOG
   - All updated files
3. **When you merge the PR** â†’ Release is automatically created with:
   - Git tag
   - GitHub release
   - Published CHANGELOG

#### Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Development with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add Docker build workflow"
git commit -m "fix: correct npm token validation"
git push origin main

# 2. Release Please automatically creates a PR "chore(main): release X.X.X"

# 3. Review and merge the PR

# 4. Release is created automatically! ðŸŽ‰
```

#### Release Please Benefits

- âœ… **Used by Google** on all their open source projects
- âœ… **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box
- âœ… **Review PR** - You control when the release happens
- âœ… **Automatic CHANGELOG** - Generated and committed to repo
- âœ… **Maintainable** - No custom bash scripts

### Using a Specific Version

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    # Specific version (recommended for stability)
    uses: sendo/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml@v1.0.0

    # Latest version (to always use the latest features)
    # uses: sendo/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml@main
```
